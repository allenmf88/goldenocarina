<b>&nbsp;<font size="4"> &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><br>
<br>
August 20, 1999</font></font></b><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><br>
<br>
In an interview with Japanese game magazine Famitsu Weekly, Shigeru Miyamoto
confirmed once and for all that the cartridge-based <b>Zelda Gaiden</b> and the
long talked-about 64DD <b>Ura Zelda</b> are two separate projects.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">&quot;We wanted to make a new game that is
based on the Zelda system,&quot; said Miyamoto in reference to Zelda Gaiden.
&quot;Also, in the light of games that require the memory Expansion Pak like
'Donkey Kong 64,' we wanted to make a 'Zelda' game that took advantage of the
Memory Pak as well. That game is Zelda Gaiden. Therefore, this will not be a
game where the locations of the dungeons are simply changed around.&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">While Miyamoto did note that &quot;The 64DD 'Ura
Zelda' is moving along on its own,&quot; he was not willing to divulge further
details regarding the game. When Nintendo first announced the already released <b>Legend
of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</b>, it was planning to make the game the 64DD disk
drive's flagship title. But hardware delays and a lack of third party support
forced Nintendo to convert Ocarina of Time to a cartridge game and start work on
a second, add-on adventure for the 64DD. Dubbed &quot;Ura Zelda&quot; (Japanese
for &quot;Another Zelda&quot;), the 64DD adventure is said to enable gamers to
revisit areas and dungeons of Ocarina of Time and experience new adventures in
familiar surroundings.</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Gaiden, on the other hand, which is best
translated as &quot;side story&quot;, only takes Ocarina of Time as a starting
point and seems to offer plenty of new dungeons in addition to an all-new quest.</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Zelda Gaiden, which is scheduled for a March
2000 release in Japan (and possibly worldwide), will be playable at next week's
Space World in Japan. There are currently no plans to unveil the 64DD-only Ura
Zelda at the same time.<br>
<br>
</font><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">August 19, 1999</font></b><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><br>
<br>
In the semi-sequel to <b>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</b>, titled <b>Zelda
Gaiden</b>, a lot of new additions have been implemented -- and a lot has
changed. The game will be playable at Nintendo's Space World in little more than
a week and, of course, we'll be there to cover it. But in the meantime, we've
compiled a list of newly released facts about the game that are sure to spark
your interest. Enjoy:</font>
<p><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000">A Parallel World</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
In Zelda Gaiden, Link finds himself in a parallel world where characters that
were introduced in the first game may be introduced slightly different. In other
words, some of the characters in the game will offer players different quests
and form decidedly opposite partnerships with our hero than they did in Ocarina
of Time.</font></font>
<p><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000">A New Story</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
The game is again set in Hyrule, a few months after the events in Ocarina of
Time took place. Naturally, Link is his young elf self again and Ganon's threat
has been completely defeated. One day, Link happens to bump into a strange
fellow in the woods, Stalkid, who mocks Link and tells him that he has &quot;foalnapped&quot;
Epona, Link's horse. Before Link even knows what's going on, Stalkid takes off
and escapes through a mysterious door. Like in &quot;Through the Looking
Glass&quot; (Alice in Wonderland), Link follows the odd guy and finds himself in
an all new world, where an ominous moon threatens to crash to earth and destroy
all life. Of course, it's Link to the rescue... With the help of his trusted
friend Navi, he must overcome the dark threat and try to prevent the deadly
catastrophe.</font></font>
<p><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000">Masks</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
The use of masks has been greatly expanded over Ocarina of Time. Link will be
able to use the power of certain masks to change his appearance and give him
special abilities. For example, one mask turns him into a Zora, enabling him to
swim underwater. Another mask will turn him into a Goron, allowing Link to curl
up into a ball and roll around. Yet another mask will turn Link into one of
those annoying Deku Nut guys and allow him to fly with the use of a flower in a
hang glider-like fashion.</font></font>
<p><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000">Weapons</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
Many of the classic Ocarina of Time weapons and items are back, including the
hammer, the bow and arrow, hookshot, the boomerang, the ocarina, the bombs, and
the dagger -- only that young Link can now use all of them. There may also be
some new items in the game that Nintendo hasn't unveiled yet.</font></font>
<p><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000">Real Real-time</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
The game will progress in real-time. There is a meter at the bottom/middle of
the screen now that shows the position of the sun or moon at all times. It is
believed that the time that passes during gameplay affects the outcome and story
of the game much more than in Ocarina of Time. This feature is no doubt a
remnant from the game's planned 64DD incarnation, where everything you do in the
game causes lasting repercussions.</font></font>
<p><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000">New Bosses</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
Gaiden features completely new, big bosses. While the specifics of all the
bosses in the game are still being kept secret, we do know of at least three: a
Gohma-like creature, an oversized frog and a giant warrior.</font></font>
<p><font size="4"><b><font color="#FF0000">Expansion Pak</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
Since the game was originally designed to run on 64DD, a unit that required the
4MB RAM expansion, it's no surprise that Gaiden (now on cart) will support the
RAM Pak. However, it is very likely that the RAM Expansion will actually be
REQUIRED to play Zelda: Gaiden -- just like with Donkey Kong 64.</font></font>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Gaiden is expected to ship in Japan March
2000.</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><br>
</font><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">August 18, 1999</font></b><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><br>
<br>
Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly reports that Nintendo's semi-sequel to <b>The
Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</b>, titled <b>Zelda Gaiden</b>, will make use
of the 4MB Expansion Pak. The game, which is now said to ship in the spring of
2000 in Japan, is expected to benefit from the extra memory in the form of more
enemies on screen and a smoothed out, consistent framerate at all times. There
are currently no plans to run the title in high-resolution mode.</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Nintendo of America has not yet officially
adopted the title for the US, but it seems fairly obvious that an American
release is a definite. Whether or not Gaiden will launch enjoy a simultaneous
launch in the US next spring remains to be seen.</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#808000" size="6" face="Arial"><b>RUMORS</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><b>In Zelda Gaidien Link
discovers his horse Epona has been kidnapped by a skull kid and has been taken
to another dimension. Link follows to discover a world like Hyrule that is
doomed. Soon it's moon will crash and if it does he can never get home. He has
to beat temples in a limited time to get back to Hyrule. Each time you do a
certain thing you will buy time. The entire game is when you are a kid and you
can ride Epona and use weapons like the bow. The ice sister from the spirit
temple now owns a little potion shop in this ..strange little world Shigeru
Myamito has come up with.<br>
<br>
Supposedly the masks will have a large part in the game, such as, if you put on
a Goron mask you become part Goron, and roll place to place, and if you put on a
zora mask, you become part Zora, and can swim underwater for a long time, etc.
and it has been delayed to December 2000. <!-- End Content -->
