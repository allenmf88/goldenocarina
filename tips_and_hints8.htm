(continued)</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Stinger:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These are small fish that live in the water in dungeons. When you get near, they
will get bigger and fly into you. Z-Target and use the Slingshot.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Shabom:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Bubbles that live in Jabu-Jabu's Belly. Use Z-Targeting and the slingshot. The
boomerang also works.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Anibus:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
I don't know WHAT that thing is, but it can't stand fire! It mimics your moves,
only in reverse. It lives in the Spirit temple.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Armos:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These statues are found in the dungeons. When you touch them, they will come
alive. Stop their movements, then use a bomb.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Spike:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
You can't defeat these, they move in a pattern, so just avoid them.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Spike Ball:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
They are found in the water temple. They look like rocks, but when you get
close, they turn into spikes &amp; chase you. Use the hookshot from a distance.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Shell Blade:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Clams that live in the Water Temple. Z-Target them &amp; when they open up, use
the hookshot quickly.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Tailparsaran:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Electric picher things that live in Jabu-Jabu's Belly. Z-Target and use the
Boomerang.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Biri:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These electric jellyfish are in Jabu-Jabu's Belly. Z-Target and use the
Boomerang. You could also use Deku Nuts, then the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Bari:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Bigger versions of Biri. When they get hit once, they will split up into three
Biri. Use the same method.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Red Bubble:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
The Bubbles are skulls surrounded by fire. The Red ones are usually seen around
lava. You can ignore them, because they don't really get in your way.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">White Bubble:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
When they stop moving, use the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Green Bubble:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
When the green fire vanishes, attack with the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Blue Bubble:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Use the shield to extinguish the flame, then attack.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Ironknuckle:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
He is probably the biggest pain in the whole game! I found that it's best NOT to
Z-Target. Just go behind him and attack like mad. If he hits you, you're in for
it, so make sure you have a way to revive yourself...</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Dead Hand: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">This
weird thing is the Bottom of the Well boss &amp; there's one in the Shadow
Temple. You'll notice lots of hands sticking up out of the ground. Attack one of
the, but don't let it grab you. Eventually a body will come up out of the
ground. Go for the head. Repeat until dead.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Freezard:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
An ice monster who freezes you with his breath. When it's safe, attack with the
sword. He will come back to life once. Get him again before he completely
regenerates.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Torch Slug:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Found in the Fire Temple. Z-Target and use the sword. You always get magic from
these guys...</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Like Like:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
The lovable shield eaters from Zelda I and IV. Use the sword a couple times but
be careful because he'll eat certain shields &amp; clothes. If he gets you, kill
him quick to get your stuff back.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Fake Door:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
When you try to open them, they fall down on you. You can tell they are fake
because it sticks out from the wall. Use the Hammer or Bombs to destroy them.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Flying Pots: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">They
look like regular pots, only they fly up and hit you.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Moblin: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">These
are strong soldiers in the Sacred Forest Meadow. If they see you, they will
charge you until you hit a wall. Stand at a corner and use the hookshot on its
back.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Club Moblin:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
He protects the entrance to the Forest Temple. If you have arrows, use them. If
not, you'll have to dodge the waves he makes with his club. Then go behind him
and use the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Dodongo:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Hit his tail with the sword three times. Watch out for his fire breath. He
explodes before he dies, so watch out.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Dodongo Larva:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
They come up out of the ground and chase you. When you hit them with the sword,
they will be defeated, but watch out. They also explode.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Tile:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
When you enter the room, they will come up out of the ground and come at you.
Use the shield.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Tentacle:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
There are three of these in Jabu-Jabu's Belly. Lock onto it and use the
Boomerang to cut it.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Leever:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
They are sand creatures that live in the desert. They constantly come up out of
the ground and attack. Just move out of the way since the go in a straight line.</font></b></p>
