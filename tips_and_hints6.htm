<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Deku Baba:</font><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#0000FF">
A man-eating plant that comes up out of the ground. They are found mostly in
Kokiri Forest and the Deku Tree. He will try to snap at you, so watch for it.
Use the sword a couple times to defeat him. You could also use Deku nuts to stun
him so it'll be easier, then use the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Big Deku Baba:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Just like the Deku Baba, only lots bigger.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Skulltulalla:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
A spider that clings to walls, vines, and stuff. They are found in just about
every dungeon. If you get near them, they will turn purple and come at you real
fast. Kill them from a distance using Z-Targeting and a slingshot or bow.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Big Skulltula:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These huge spiders hang from the ceiling and when you get close, they will drop
down. If you get too close, they will spin around and knock you on your @$$:)
When they turn around and expose their belly, use the sword to get rid of it.
Big Skulltulas can be found in the dungeons.<br>
Hint: In some cases, you'll need the Lense of Truth to see them.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Gold Skulltula:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These are the Spiders of the Curse. There are 100 of them in the game. They can
be found anywhere. Z-Targeting won't work, so you have to kill them w/o it. Use
whatever method you choose.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Keese, Fire Keese, &amp; Ice
Keese:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"> These are little black
bats. They can be found in dungeons, and a few other places. Use Z-Targeting and
wait till they get close &amp; use the sword. Or if they stop, Z-Target them
&amp; use your slingshot or something. Be careful of the Fire/Ice Keese because
if they fly into you, you're in for a treat!</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Guay:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
He's just like a Keese, only he looks like a bird. They are found near Lake
Hylia, and there are tons of then in the desert colossus.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Gohma Larva:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
They are tiny versions of Gohma. They live in little egg things on the ceiling.
They can only be found in the Deku Tree. A good way to get rid of them is to
look for the eggs, then use the slingshot. If you miss the eggs, they'll drop
down from the ceiling and come for you. Attack with the sword before they pounce
on you.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Scrub:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
They hide in the bushes, then when you get close, they'll spit Deku Nuts at you.
Use Z-Targeting and the Deku Shield to reflect them back. When they get hit,
they'll run around. Now hit them with the sword once to finish the job. Also, if
you're in a big hurry, avoid the nuts and just use the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Business Scrub:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Just like Scrubs, only when you reflect the Deku Nut back, they won't run away,
they'll give you hints or sell you stuff.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Stalchild:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Little skeletons that only show up at night in Hyrule Field. Just use the sword
once or twice &amp; that's it. Just watch out because they keep coming until
morning. If you wear the Bunny Head, they won't come out.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Peahat/Peahat Larva:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
What do you know, they're back! Only this time, they are MUCH easier to deal
with:) They're only found in Hyrule Field. When the Peahats come up out of the
ground, go for the roots. For the Peahat Larva, just use the shield. When they
bounce off, they'll die.</font></b>
