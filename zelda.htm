of the game, princess Zelda, has time and again shown herself to be both
mysterious and seductive. There is so little we really do know about her. She is
the cornerstone that ties the Zelda games together and provides the purpose for
Link's quests though Hyrule. She is an integral part of the fairytale and the
legend that to this day is never fully understood. Perhaps in retrospect of the
Middle Ages she is the damsel in distress who must be saved by a chivalrous
knight that is Link but often the storyline provides for a more deeper bond
between the two that is not superficially apparent.</b></font></p>

        is a very powerful yet outwardly weak person. She hides her true power
        beneath a persona of helplessness. So often is she taken advantage of
        because of her unwillingness to counterattack her aggressor Ganon, yet
        she does have the ability to overcome him. Her abilities range from
        telepathy, to telekinesis, to higher reality awareness and environmental
        manipulation. Indeed she is a formidable mental foe for Ganon on any one
        day. But what does he see in her that he is lacking? The answer lies in
        her immaculate nature, her purity if you will. This is very analogous to
        the portrayal of the Christian belief of the &quot;Virgin Mary&quot; -
        one who is pure in body and spirit, god's chosen conduit for divine
        holiness. To Ganon she represents something that he will never become.
        Her luminescent purity blinds his evil and flawed psyche becoming a
        focal point for his innate personal inadequacies. His jealousy of her
        causes him to lash out and attempt to destroy that which he sees is in
        opposition to his agenda - to obtain the Triforce and be an omnipotent
        god-like entity. Zelda and Ganon are at two opposite poles of existence.
        Yet Zelda in turn needs Ganon to limit her so that a balance is made
        between the forces. A Yin and a Yang - Ganon uses hatred and fear to
        overcome her and Zelda uses love and hope to overcome him. The one who
        keeps this balance maintained is Link the Legendary Hero of Time who
        Zelda uses as the tool to keep the balance in motion. This is a
        circumstance that plays itself out repeatedly in the Zelda series of
        games.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>Zelda has
played a very important underlying role in the development of the quest for the
Zelda games. The First game of the series is actually Zelda 64. In this game we
see her first incarnation. She is the 7th Sage chosen by the goddesses and the
manipulator of time and circumstance. Using Link as agent to both bait Ganon and
later withdraw him into the Dark World (A hidden part of the Sacred Realm) she
is actually the one in control throughout Zelda 64 acting as both Sheik and Sage
while still maintaining that outward appearance of weakness (also a ploy to
confuse and manipulate Ganon). Evidence of Zelda's true powers include the
psychic imprinting she makes upon the Ocarina of Time when Link find's it in the
River as well as the intense spiritual energy she uses against Ganon in the last
scenes of the final battle. Also include her ability to project a veil of
deception as Sheik, her latent philosophical nature, and her ability to control
Link's perception of time, and you are left with a very deep character indeed.
(of Sephirothean strata) Yet to Link she remains the damsel in distress and to
Ganon she is the one who must be eliminated. Indeed the Goddesses and Zelda are
very close on a higher spiritual level. She is guardian of their essence the
Triforce and the only one who is aware of it's true power. In Zelda: A Link to
the Past her future reincarnation is again assailed by the Thief Ganon who
manipulates a mysterious Wizard/Manifestation Agahnim to encapsulate her luminescence
so that he can overcome her control over the Triforce and break the
Seal created by the Seven Sages so long ago. But again she reaches
telepathically toward Link to direct his innate courageous nature against that
which is bringing destruction and despair to that which is pure. In the end it
is Link who touches the Triforce and brings tranquility back to Hyrule and safety
to the Triforce. Link's Awakening during this time causes him to transcend
reality and fall deep into the depths of his own mind creating a subconscious
world of allies and foes propagated by his experience with Zelda and the
Triforce. Centuries pass and again the cycle is reborn (The Legend of Zelda -
NES) when Ganon Remanifests and captures Zelda and the Triforce of Power to
bring ruination to Hyrule. Since Ganon has long since lost his humanity by this
time all the emotional qualities he was in Life become his essence throughout
time and his desire and lust for ultimate control continue to reappear
throughout history on Cataclysm's Eve when bond of darkness is strongest. Zelda
again calls upon the savior Link to bring him back into lethargy and once again
reunite the Goddess' Triforce. In the end Link is triumphant and Zelda is
brought back into the light. Time abandons these Dark Ages and new era of
expansion takes place in Hyrule. (Zelda II: The Adventure of Link) Yet Ganon's
lust still permeates the unspoken corners of Hyrule and another Wizard feeding
off Ganon's evil portends to destroy Zelda and bring the Triforce back to Ganon.
Zelda again falls under the spell of hatred and Link is called upon to return
normalcy back to the seven holy places and destroy the Wizard and reawaken Zelda
from her submission to evil's grasp.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>Zelda and Link
share a mysterious bond that goes beyond Hero and ill-fated Damsel. Link and
Zelda are never seen engaging in a relationship beyond the goal that must be achieved
the maintained of the sanctity of the Glory of Hyrule's freedom yet they
are dependant upon each other to keep the balance of control in check. Link and
his reincarnations rarely know the truth of themselves and their origins. Link
is an outcast, one with no family yet still upon the whims of circumstance is
thrown into the battle for the maintenance of Zelda's purity. Yet Zelda remains
as a mentor and teacher to guide and mold Link into the fulfillment of prophesy
throughout time. It is quite possible to assume that Zelda and Link may be
brother and sister and share a connection that is maintained by bloodline and
resurfaces throughout time or perhaps at a higher level they are spiritual
brother and sister chosen by the goddesses to uphold and protect the virtues of
the Triforce. An example of this can be derived from Zelda 64 when Link and
Zelda are imprinted with the Mark of the Triforce upon their hands and become
the containers for The Triforce of Courage and the Triforce of Wisdom
respectively. Even though Ganon managed to capture the one part of the Triforce
the Essence of the remaining two sections embedded themselves safely within Link
and Zelda.</b></font></p>
