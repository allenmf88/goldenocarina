Wearing masks can actually pay off! If you wear the bunny mask while outside in
the Hyrule Field, the skeletons will not come out. If you wear the skull mask in
dungeons, bats won't bother you!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">There are many secrets with
the Gossip Stones hidden all over the land of Hyrule. Here is what happens when
you shoot or hit a Gossip with a weapon.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Ice or Fire Arrow-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
The stone will spin around really fast, then it will grow tall, the return to
normal.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Megaton Hammer- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">It
will get totally flat, then return to normal.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Bomb or Bombchu-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
It will flash in a countdown then launch into the sky.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Sword (Any One)-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
It will tell you the time.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Hook/Longshot- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">It
will dance!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Potion From The Sun- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">This
is just a simple trick. Does everyone remember where they first found the Fire
Arrows? Stand on the island in Lake Hylia near to the inscription that hints at
how to receive the Fire Arrows. Wait for the morning sun to be rising over the
horizon, then shoot a normal arrow over the island in the distance and into the
sun, just like what you did to get the Fire Arrows, and one of those small green
potions will drop down that will partially recover your magic meter.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">There are numerous locations
of &quot;big&quot; fairies in Zelda. They look almost exactly like normal red
fairies, except they glow slightly more, and look like a hovering pink globe
without wings rather than the typical fairy. The purpose of these fairies are to
refill both your magic meter and heart containers. Unfortunately, they cannot be
caught in bottles, probably because of their size.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">Whenever Navi turns green and
you can't seem to find the reason, it is probably because there is big fairy
hidden there. Usually you will need to play a specific song for the fairy to
appear, and it will appear just like a chest does in a dungeon! If you find one
not mentioned here (I didn't even begin to describe where some are in dungeons)
then play every non-teleporting song you have. Here are just some locations of
these &quot;big&quot; fairies in the overworld:</font></b></p>
<ol>
  <li><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Anywhere!- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">Find
    a Gossip Stone and play the Song of Storms for one to appear.</font></b>
  <li><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Lost Woods</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">-
    Near the shortcut to Zora's River play the Song of Storms. Navi should turn
    green at the shore of the small pool of water with the underwater shortcut.</font></b>
  <li><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Hyrule Field-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
    At the small pond that is formed by the river branch that does NOT go to
    Zora's River. If you entered Hyrule Field from Kokiri Forest it would be a
    little ways to the right. Play the Song of Storms once again on the shore of
    the water where Navi turns green.</font></b>
  <li><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Death Mountain Trail- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">At
    the red flag on the trail to Goron City play the Song of Storms for a big
    fairy to appear.</font></b>
  <li><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Lake Hylia- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">On
    the small island in Lake Hylia where you get the Fire Arrows. This time play
    the Sun's Song for the big fairy to appear.</font></b></li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Hidden Idem Shop in Ganon's
    Castle- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">If your having
    trouble in Ganon's Castle, follow my instructions to find a hidden and very
    useful item shop. First, go to the lower level in the main room. Next, put
    on your Lens of Truth and hug the circular wall. You will eventually find a
    space in the wall. Go inside and there are fairies flying around and Deku
    scrubs selling potions. Make sure you catch the fairies with your bottles.
    Then, when you die, they'll fill all your hearts and bring you back to life.</font></b>
    <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Gold Rupee
    Locations</b></font>
    <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">1.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
    Outside of Goron City, you will see a ring of stones. Play the Song of
    Storms inside of the ring, and a grotto will open. Open the chest and get a
    rupee.</font></b>
    <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">2.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
    Inside of Goron City, you will notice an area of lava. To cross it, use the
    Longshot, or play the Song of Time twice to make blocks appear. Once across,
    a Gold Rupee can be found.</font></b>
    <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">3.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
    Go to Kakariko Village, and stand by the tree that's near the entrance. Take
    20 paces east of the tree. If you have the Stone of Agony, you will feel a
    shake. Place a bomb on the ground. Once the grotto opens, kill the zombies
    and claim your prize.</font></b>
    <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">4.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
    Inside of Death Mountain Crater, you will eventually find a time block to
    step on. This block makes a chest appear. If you can get to it in time,
    you've found another rupee.</font></b>
    <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">5. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">If
    you manage to get all 100 Gold Skulltula, go back to the House of Skulltula
    to receive your reward.</font></b>
    <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">6.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
    You need the Gold Gauntlets in order to get this rupee. In Goron City go to
    the room where all the boulders are. Go to the left and start picking up the
    stones and throwing them until you get to a treasure chest. The Gold rupee
    is inside</font></b>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">How To
    Defeat Ganon</font></b>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>After Link defeats
    Ganondorf in the tower, his relief soon fades as the King of Gerudo thieves
    makes one more wish on the triforce of Power. He transforms himself into
    Ganon - a creature that reflects the true nature of his heart. With a mighty
    blow, he knocks away the Master Sword from your hands! A ring of fire now
    encircles the battle field making it impossible for you to retrieve it.</b></font>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>Quickly, and carefully aim
    a Light Arrow into Ganon's eyes. Once he's stunned, go behind him and use
    the Megaton hammer to hit his tail. You must repeat this process until the
    circle of fire subsides. When the moment comes, run to the Princess who has
    retrieved the sword for you! Note: The Big Goron Sword is useless in this
    final fight so make sure you equip the Master Sword.</b></font>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>When fighting the mutated
    Ganon, simply bumrush the evil villain and proceed to slash violently at
    point blank range. It's very important to make sure Link is facing Ganon's
    belly at all times as he constantly turns. While swinging away, don't worry
    if every blow is deflected; eventually, Link somehow sneaks a few cuts
    behind Ganon and actually hits his tail (his only vulnerable spot). Most of
    the time, Link will completely pass through Ganon providing easier access to
    his tail (just remember to keep slashing!). Only a few successful hits are
    needed to finish the job. As Gannon falls defeated, the Princess Zelda will
    put a temporary restraining spell over him while Link delivers the final
    blow! Then, enjoy the final animated sequence - you've more than earned it!</b></font>
