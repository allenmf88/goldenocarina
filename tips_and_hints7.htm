(continued)</b></font></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Poe: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">These
are found in Hyrule Field and the graveyard. Use the sword when they are
visible. Watch out for the fire they throw at you.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Big Poe:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
There are only 10 of them, and you only see them as adult link when you have
Epona. Use Bow. You have to be quick because they will run from you.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Poe Sisters: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">They
live in the the Forest Temple. When you solve their puzzles, Z-Target them and
use the Bow.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Octorock:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Ocotpus that lives in the water. They'll pop out and spit rocks at you. Reflect
them back.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Tektite:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These are jumping spiders. They can be found almost anywhere. The blue ones live
near water. The red ones live on Death Mountain. Z-Target &amp; use sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Stalfos:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Strong, powerful skeletons. Can be found in the dungeons. Z-Target &amp; attack
when he lets his guard down. When he attacks you, use shield.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Wolfos/White Wolfos:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Wolf creatures that can be found in the Sacred Fores Meadow &amp; the dungeons.
Use the hookshot, then go in and attack with the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Lizalfos/Dinalfos:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These are found in the dungeons. They make this weird noise, which kinda sounds
like my cat:). Anyways, Z-Target and use the sword. When he attacks, use the
shield. Dinalfos jumps around more and is a little faster.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Wallmaster:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
They are big hands that drop down from the ceiling. Make sure to keep moving
because if they grab you, you'll end up at the beginning of the dungeon. Attack
before they go back up to the ceiling. (You might want to let them grab you
once, it looks kinda cool:)</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Floormaster:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
These are really annoying! They crawl around on the floor and when you get near,
they'll turn green and try to hit you. Move out of the way. When they turn back
to their original color, hit them with the sword once. They will split up into
three parts. Dispose of them before they come together again.<br>
Hint: In some cases, you'll need the Lense of Truth to see them.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Beamos: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">These
statues will shoot lasers at you. Try to avoid his eye and throw a bomb at it.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">ReDead:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Zombie things that paralyse you when they see you. (at least most of the time.)
Use the Sun's Song to paralyse them, then use the sword. You don't need the
Sun's Song, it's just easier.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Gibdo:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Same as ReDead, only they are mummies. I think they are a bit more powerful
though...</font></b>
