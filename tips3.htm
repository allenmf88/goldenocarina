Sword</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">To get Biggoron's Sword, you
must go through a trading game, like Zelda: Link's Awakening for Game Boy. I
will give the code in step-by-step order:</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">1. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">In
Kakariko Village, you will get an egg from the girl who raises cuccos. It will
soon hatch and Link can take it to a nearby building to awake Talon. Go back to
the girl and she will give him Cojiro, a cucco.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">2. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">Go
to the Lost Woods and you will see a boy on a tree stump. Seeing the cucco will
lift his spirits and he will give you an Odd Mushroom to deliver to his
grandmother in Kakariko Village.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">3.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
The woman in the potion ship will give Link an Odd Potion in return for the Odd
Mushroom. Bring it back to the Lost Woods.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">4. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">When
you get back to the Lost Woods, the boy will be gone and a young girl will be in
his place. Give her the potion in return for the Poacher's Saw.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">5.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Go to the carpenter in Gerudo Valley. Give him the Saw and he will give you the
Broken Goron's Sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">6.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Make your way up Death Valley and visit Biggoron. He will take the sword and
give you a prescription for eyedrops from King Zora.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">7. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">Go
to Zora's Domain and bring him the prescription. He will give you an Eyeball
Frog, the main for the potion. Bring the Frog to Lake Hylia.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">8.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Bring the Frog to the Professor at Lake Hylia. He will turn the Frog into the

3 days and return to Biggoron. Give him the Claim Check and he will give you
Biggoron's' Sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">Biggoron's Sword is the most
powerful weapon in the game. It is twice as strong as the Master Sword! However,
