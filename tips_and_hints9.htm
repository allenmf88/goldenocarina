<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Queen Gohma:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
After the movie plays, she will drop down and move towards you. Use Z-Targeting
on her and when she opens her eye, use the slingshot. This will stun her. Now
use the sword until she moves away. Now she'll climb around and drop a few Gohma
Larvas to the ground. Kill them and wait for Queen Gohma to drop down again.
Keep repeating the process until dead.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">King Dodongo:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
This is a pretty easy battle. You need the Hylian Shield if you want to be
successful. First, he'll roll around the battle area, then then run into a
corner. Now, he'll open up his mouth and spit fire at you. Before he can spit
fire at you, Z-Target his mouth and throw a bomb in there. When he swallows it,
it'll explode inside his mouth &amp; he'll be stunned. Whack him with the sword
until he balls up. Right when he starts to roll, DUCK!! He'll go over your
shield &amp; you won't get hurt. Repeat until dead.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Mini-Boss - Big Octo:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Firs off, Z-Target him and NEVER lose the target or you will get screwed big
time. When he comes towards you, use the boomerang to stun him. He'll turn
around and go the other way. Quickly use the boomerang again to get him in the
backside. When he's stunned, use the sword on that little green area. Repeat
until dead.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Barinade:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
He is strikingly familiar to Arrghus on Zelda 3… but it looks really cool when
he diesJ First, you have to get rid of the Bari that protect him. Z-Target him
and keep moving around so you won't get hit by his electric beams. Keep using
the Boomerang until Barinade gets stunned. Now go for the individual Baris. Kill
them as fast as possible. If you don't they will attach to Barinade on electric
beams &amp; spin around extrememly fast, kind of like Arrghus again. Watch out
for that! In the last phase, just Z-Target and use the boomerang to stun him,
then use the sword.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Phantom Ganon:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
This guy can be easy if you know what you are doing. Make sure you have a good
supply of arrows. Stand in the middle and keep your bow out. Look around the
pictures and shoot him when he is about to come out. If you miss, he'll do a
real good lightning attack. RUN fast out of the way. You'll know when it's
coming because you can hear a sound. After a couple hits, he'll move into his
last phase. Z-Target him and when he gets ready to throw a magic ball at you,
hit it back with the sword. When he falls to the ground, use the sword again.
Repeat until dead.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Volvagia: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">This
guy's a pain, but no too bad. When he first pops up out of a hole, he'll swipe
at you. Avoid that, then Z-Target his head &amp; smash it with the hammer a
couple times. Now he'll go back into the hole. When he comes back out, watch out
for the fire he spits at you. He'll also hover over you. When he does that, duck
using the R button &amp; he can't hit you. When he finally goes back into the
hole, then comes back out, use the hammer again after he swipes at you. Now
comes his next attack, huge rocks. The chanses of you getting hit are pretty
slim to begin with, but if you want to be safe, hang off the edge of the
platform. Repeat this process until dead. Also, the Biggoron's Sword might be
useful...</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Morpha:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
This guy's pretty simple. Watch out for his tentacles and Z-Target the heart, or
whatever that thing is. Use the longshot to pull it towards you and whack it
with the sword. Repeat until dead.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Bongo Bongo:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
First, Z-Target a hand and shoot it with an arrow. Then do the other. Now
activate the Lense of Truth. Charge up your sword and release it when the rest
of him comes at you. When he's stunned, whack him with the sword. Repeat until
dead. Biggoron sword helps big time.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Twinrova:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Now this is a real thrill! The ending is worth all the troubls:) Twin Rova is
composed of two witches, Koume and Kotake. One with the Fire maic, the other has
Ice magic. Usually they stay close together, so for the first phase, all you
have to do is use the Mirror Shield to reflect the spells at the other witch.
Example: Aim Fire back at the witch with the Ice magic. Repeat until the final
phase. Now, the two witches will merge into one. Now is a good time to use the
Z-Targeting system. You still have to reflect the attacks back at them/it, but
the Mirror Shield will absorb the first two attacks, then the third will work.
Note that it must be the same spell, so if Twin Rova shoots fire and you are
using the Ice attack, don't let the fire hit the shield. After each hit, Twin
Rova will fall to the ground. Use this opportunity to whack her with the sword a
few times. Repeat this process a couple times &amp; all your hard work will be
rewarded with a cool movie &amp; a heart container!</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Ganondorf:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
He's pretty easy compared to the first one, that's for sure:) Right off, go to a
corner, because he will take out the floor around the platform. When he shoots
his magic energy balls at you, hit them back to him with your sword. Keep doing
it until he gets stunned. Now use a Light Arrow. When he falls to the platform,
use the longshot to pull yourself towards him and use the sword on his tail. The
Biggoron's Sword makes the battle alot easier &amp; shorter. One of Ganondorf's
attacks is to make a big black ball of energy and throw it at you. It will split
up into 4 smaller balls and you will get hurt bad if they hit you. Don't bother
with the Mirror Shield. The best way to defend yourself is to do a Whirling
Blade Attack and reflect them back at Ganondorf. Repeat until dead. You're in
for a nice scene afterwards!</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Ganon</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">:
OK this is it, I promise:) Let me warn you that the camera angles are really
messed up, so be careful on this one. If you know what you're doing, it's not so
bad. Make sure you have life and the Biggoron's sword to make things easier. If
you don't have the sword, use the hammer. Ganon will follow you with those Big
Ass swords and boy are you in for it if you get hit!! Run towards him fast and
roll between his legs. Turn around and tap the Z button so you can see his tail.
If you have the Biggoron's Sword, use it. If not use the hammer. Repeat until
you can access the Master Sword. When you get the Master Sword, repeat the above
process until he dies.</font></b></p>
