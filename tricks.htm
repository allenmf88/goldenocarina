Fountain-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"> This trick allows
you to get into a secret cave in Zora's Fountain. First of all, go to Zora's
Fountain, and stand on the iceberg where Lord Jabu-Jabu used to live. Using the
Up C Button, look to the right on the wall, and you should see an opening in the
wall. Dive into the water, then swim over to the island that has a cave leading
to Goron City. You should see a gray boulder. Use you Golden Gauntlets to lift
the boulder, than throw it. An opening will appear. Fall down into the opening,

<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Killer Runner-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">&nbsp;
While you are a child, go to Hyrule Field during the day. If and when you see
the running man, stand a distance in front of where he is going to run. Then,
when he hits you can get anywhere from 5-3 hearts COMPLETELY taken away!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Get Epona Without Jumping The
Fence- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">There is a way to get
Epona in Lon Lon Ranch without jumping the fences. After racing Ingo and beating
him twice, you will get Epona but will be locked in the ranch. Normally, you
have to jump over one of the fences. If you find this difficult, you can save
and restart your game. Leave the Temple of Time and go into Hyrule Field. Use
your ocarina and play Epona's Song to call Epona. She should come to you. (Note:
Try to be near the middle of Hyrule Field when using Epona's Song. If you are
too close to the castle, Epona will not be able to reach you.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Swordless LInk 2- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">To
do this, you must first do the Fishing Trick where you get your pole out of the
pond (Below). Go across the narrow part of the lake to the right of the fishing
place. Go to a spot between the fence where the scarecrows are and the wall.
Pull out the fishing rod and cast. Link will sit there like he's fishing. Save
your game. If this trick worked there will be a Deku stick where your sword
should be. In the menu the Master Sword will be gone. Don't try and pull out a
Deku stick because it will freeze and you will have to turn the power off and
then back on (reset wont work). The way to get your sword back is to put it back
in the Temple of Time and then pull it out again. Don't do this with Biggorons
sword. If you do it will still be in the menu but you cant select it and
Biggoron wont give you another one.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">NOTE TO THE READER:</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">

all for 20+ rupees. Once you've gained all the money, exit and go in again. The

<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">2- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">To

<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">3- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">You
must be adult link to do this trick. After completing the sleeping man and
little girl sections of Adult Link's Trading Sequence, go once again to the

When you are Adult Link or kid Link, find the guy kneeling down who looks like
he's begging. For kid Link, he is The Market, adult link, he is in Kariko
Village. Remember where he was. Then go into one of the numerous caves from the
holes in the ground, and destroy a bugs nest (big brown beehive looking things
in top corners of most caves). Bottle a bug. If you see a fish in one of the
puddles, bottle it instead. if you have more than one bottle, exit the cave and
come back for another fish. Or you can release a bug, and re-catch the ones that
come out. bring the bottled goodies to the begging guy. He will now ask you to
sel him the contents of your bottle(s). Select the fish or bug, and use it on
him. He will give you 50 rupees for a bug and 100 rupees for a fish. this is
really good for when you are low on cash and need to buy items.</font></b>

When you are a kid, go to Hyrule Castle during the day. Walk up onto one of the
chains that holds up the drawbridge. Now play the 'Sun Song', making it night.
When the drawbridge raises, you will go up with it. When the draw bridge reaches
the top, walk along the edge of the drawbridge. You will get 60 rupies for doing
this. When you are done, drop off the edge into the castle (Press A + B when
landing so you don't get hurt) and do it again. This is a fast, easy way to get
rupies.</font></b>
