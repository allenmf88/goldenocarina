<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b><i>Returning from his time travel
adventures, young Link rode home on the back of his trusty (and equally young)
horse, Epona. As he cautiously made his way through the foggy, dark woods, two
fairies appeared out of nowhere. Startled by the quick-moving, glowing
creatures, Epona reared up and sent Link flying to the ground. As Link lay
unconscious, a third stranger appeared out of the mist: a mask-wearing imp by
the name of Stalkid. Looking for valuables, Stalkid soon found Link's Ocarina of
Time, took it, and tried to escape on Epona.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b><i>Link of course quickly followed and
soon came upon a doorway in a large tree. He slowly stepped inside -- and fell
into a bottomless pit that transported him into a weird, yet oddly familiar
world full of familiar faces. But while the landscape may have looked familiar,
one thing was clearly different: In the sky above loomed a gigantic moon, slowly
falling down onto this world...</i></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b><i>&quot;In a few more days, this world
will end.&quot; So spoke those living there. Even as they waited, time passed
mercilessly. &quot;If you can find the masked one, you may find a clue to saving
this realm.&quot;</i></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b><i>And so Link embarked on a new
adventure to halt the setting of the moon on this strange world and to find his
way back to his own land.</i></b></font></p>
