<p align="left"><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#0000FF">At the exact
point where the three goddesses left Hyrule and entered the heavens, they left
behind three mystical golden triangles. Together these three triangles came to
be known as the holy Triforce. The three parts consisted of the Triforce of
Wisdom, the Triforce of Power, and the Triforce of Courage. As a whole, the
Triforce has the power to grant the wishes of one who touches it. However, the
way the Triforce grants these wishes are a direct reflection of the heart of the
wisher. If one pure of heart touches it with all three essences in balance, the
world would enter a golden age. If one with an evil heart touches it without all
three in balance, disaster will strike. The Triforce does not differentiate
between the two, it just reflects and grants the wishes. So when Ganon finally
seized control over the Triforce, it reflected what was in his heart and turned
the Golden Land into the Dark World.</font></b></p>
