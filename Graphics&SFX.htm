        <br>
        I can't honestly say that this game has the best graphics ever (the
        battle sequences from Final Fantasy are probably the greatest in-game
        graphics known to man, and lets not forget those crazy water effects in
        Wave Race 64) but in terms of sheer frequency/regularity, the graphics
        are unmatched on the N64, and few games on other platforms can even
        begin to touch this game's visuals. Its one thing to have beautiful
        rendered backgrounds (like in Final Fantasy 8), but this is an entirely
        3D world and there is NO pop- up/draw-in whatsoever. This may not sound
        like much, but there is something incredibly satisfying when you can see
        far off into the distance in any given environment. It helps solidify
        that feeling of completeness, and gives added depth of realism. After
        visiting some of the game's locales, and seeing no graphical glitches or
        pop-up, you begin to see these environments as real places that you'd
        like to return to, and not just texture-mapped polygons. Among my
        favorite locales: the cemetery, Lake Hylia and Hyrule Fields. To be
        riding aimlessly around Hyrule Field on horseback, wading through the
        clear blue waters or standing in the pouring rain, soaking in
        environmental details... is nothing short of a religious experience for
        me. I love the look and feel of the game's many dungeons and certain
        boss encounters are like battling with Call spells from Final Fantasy 7.
        So, although I can't honestly say this game has the best graphics ever,
        for me the visuals do exactly what they're meant to do: create a
        realistic fantasy setting... and that means I couldn't ask for anything
        more. Of course, all environments will have some sort of wall to prevent
        you from exiting, but the locales are so huge chances are you won't
        notice them much and hey, they never bothered me much.<br>

        </font><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Atmospheric Details
        Galore</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><br>
        <br>
        Z64 comes packed with atmospheric details. For example, when you enter
        certain areas (or play the Song of Storms on your ocarina) everything
        gets dark and the sky fills with dark clouds and it starts raining!
        You'll see flashes of lightning in the sky, amidst the rain falling all
        around you! The graveyard is easily one of the most atmospheric gaming
        environments ever made. The following are some of my favorite details:<br>
        <br>
        -Link has a shadow, and depending on the light sources in the
        environment (the sun, torches or even the light emanating from his fairy
        Navi) actually affects the shadow. It grows long or shortens, changes
        direction and fades depending on Link's proximity to the light, and it
        looks awesome.<br>
        -Depending on the temperature of the environment you're in, Link will
        react to the heat/cold in his idle animations. Leave the controller
        alone for a moment while adventuring and Link will sigh and wipe sweat
        from his forehead, or shiver and sneeze!<br>
        -I love the animation routines for when Link mounts/dismounts his horse,
        or how he gently pats Epona's neck in the idle animation.<br>
        -Graphically, the game does some interesting lens effects for certain
        environments. For example, when in extremely hot locations or when you
        first dive underwater, the lens of the camera will actually distort and
        fluctuate!<br>
        -If you dive underwater, Link eventually comes up for air with a great
        *AH!* as he gasps for air.<br>
        -If you fall/jump from a great height, and don't roll out of the impact,
        Link will land with a *yelp* and shudder with pain as the impact racks
        his body.<br>
        -Sometimes it gets foggy, but the fog is used only for atmospheric
        flavor (not to cover pop-up).<br>
        -Link will gently sway with the music he creates using his ocarina.<br>
        -The physics when Link wears the iron boots underwater, or when child
        Link dons the bunny ears are also fantastic.<br>
        -Of special note is the way the mirror shield reflects light. Standing
        under a focused beam of light allows Link to take out the mirror shield
        and control the direction in which the light hits the walls, ceiling,
        and floor (it looks really great!). The mirror shield will also reflect
        light sources around Link, such as the blue light emanating from warp
        points generated after a boss encounter!<br>
        -Typical of most N64 games, there are certain objects and enemies which
        use a reflection map to look shiny. This is an effect that has been used
        rarely on other consoles, if at all (Xenogears has used it correctly
        once, and Wipeout XL uses a fake reflection map for medals obtained).<br>
        -Sparks, shockwaves and simulated particle effects flash across the
        screen when your sword or other items make contact with walls, enemy
        shields or even just rocky/hard terrain. These are just some of the cool
        visuals you'll come across in the game... Its totally awesome!</font></b></td>

        <br>
        So many N64 games have pretty crappy music. Even some of the better
        games out there just don't sound all that great. But Zelda's music is
        actually quite good. You'll remember some of the themes from past games,
        such as Ganon's theme. But there are plenty of great new songs too. From
        the haunting themes of the dungeons you'll have to explore, to the
        upbeat tunes of Kakariko village, you won't have any complaints. And the
        music does some interesting transitions, which are usually unnoticeable.
        The ocarina melodies you can play are also ingenious little songs in
        themselves, considering their simplicity. There's an orchestrated
        version of Z64's soundtrack, which may be imported, and believe me its
        GREAT! Although most songs seem to be played by a quartet of stringed
        instruments, there are some songs taught have a full orchestra. Just
        about anyone who's been playing games since the good old NES days should
        LOVE hearing the classic Zelda theme song, Ganon's theme or a
        combination of the various themes from all the Zelda games ever made
        (excluding of course those nasty, nasty CD-I games). Besides that, the
        CD also includes stirring renditions of Z64's locale themes, like the
        Gerudo Desert (which sounds 100 times better orchestrated), as well as
        an unsynthed version of Malon's singing, a song containing all the
        ocarina melodies, and more! Its a great album I think any Zelda fan
        (even those who don't even own the N64 like myself!) should get. I'm
        going to try and put up AT LEAST one MP3 file so you can hear an
        orchestrated song or two.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Ambient Sound Effects
        Galore</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><br>
        <br>
        Z64 comes packed with ambient sound effects galore! Of course, not *all*
        the SFX need to be ambient, and the ones that aren't are what you'd
        expect: sword slashes, hookshot hits, the cloppity-clop of your horse,
        etc. its all good. But the ambient sounds are really something special.
        For example, when it begins to rain, you can hear harsh thunder booming
        overhead, and the actual sound of the rain drops is perfect! If you turn
        the volume way up, close your eyes... its like actually standing outside
        in the rain! Certain areas get windy, and sometimes your actions echo if
        you're in a cavern with the proper acoustics. To signal the change from
        night to day, you'll hear a rooster's cockadoodledo, and when its night
        you'll hear a wolf baying at the moon somewhere (if you're under water,
        these noises get all warped). At night time it generally gets pretty
        quiet, so you can hear all sorts of creatures lurking somewhere - but
        its not meant to be scary or anything. The SFX are so good you'll know
        when there's a bat in the room, and you can even use them to locate
        those damned gold skulltulas! Its just really great detail. Other SFX
        that are spot-on include: Link's foot steps, running water (waterfalls),
        flames, and Link's various vocalizations. And, lest we forget, you'll
        enjoy hearing that classic Zelda &quot;dee- do-do-do-dee&quot; when you
        uncover a secret or solve a maddening puzzle - its nostalgia on the same
        level as hearing that classic Final Fantasy theme song with the harps!</font></b></td>
