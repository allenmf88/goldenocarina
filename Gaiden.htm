<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>One day, deep in the forest,
Link encountered a stranger wearing a mysterious mask. Without as much as an
explanation, the unusual fellow stole the pony young Link was riding – his
beloved Epona – and escaped through a doorway into a warped dimension. Link of
course quickly followed and soon found himself trapped in a strange, yet oddly
familiar world full of familiar faces. But while the landscape may have looked
familiar, one thing was clearly different: In the sky above loomed a gigantic
moon, slowly falling down onto this world...&nbsp;<br>
&quot;In a few more days, this world will end.&quot; So spoke those living
there. Even as they waited, time passed mercilessly. &quot;If you can find the
masked one, you may find a clue to saving this realm.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
And so Link embarks on a new adventure to halt the setting of the moon on this
strange world and to find his way back to his own land</b></font><center>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">Take it as you will but it
sounds very peculiar. As The Legend Of Zelda: Links Awakening for the Gameboy,
Link will not be adventuring in Hyrule but in a completely different world.
Little about this new world is known, but you can expect huge forests and
mountains, so expect something like Hyrule, but with more detailed terrain. What
at first may seem as a childish plot of finding Epona grows into something more
sinister which isn’t the cliché which is saving Hyrule from Gannon but a new
plot along the lines of saving this “world” from the fire in the sky.&nbsp;
(It is not a fire but a Moon, the moon is apparently being drawn towards this
world at an alarming rate and Link is once again destined to save the lives of
many innocent people.)</font></b><center>

<p><font size="-1" color="#ffffff" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font><b><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">&quot;If
you can find the masked one” – Remember those masks from Zelda: TOOT?&nbsp;
Well those masks will play a much more vital role in Zelda: MoM. Wearing a Mask
not only gives you special features and different dialogues with NPC’s such as
in Zelda: TOOT, but the masks transform Link into other races such as the
enigmatic Zora or the robust Goron. Each race has its own pros and cons, i.e.
obviously the Zora mask will make Link an excellent swimmer, and from certain
screenshots very dextrous since the Zora does high kicks. The Goron mask will
allow Link to turn into a very large Goron and roll down hills at very high
speeds (I speculate this is needed to break down boulders). Looking closer to
the pictures, it seems as if each mask /race will come with their own
corresponding instrument. The Zora has a guitar, the Goron a set of drums, and
so on. What these new instruments are for is at the moment unknown, but one can
speculate that they will be played the same way as the Ocarina, and most likely
have the same use as the Ocarina. (I.e. controlling time, weather, and so on.)&nbsp;
The 4 Mb expansion pack seems to be very popular among developers and it is
needed to play this game. The expansion pack is reported to be used to give the
game much more better graphics (as if they weren’t great already) Miyamoto
also promised that Zelda: MOM will be a challenge for the gamers that felt
Zelda: TOOT was easy. With all these new features one can only imagine what all
this will add to the game play and plot.&nbsp;</font></b><center>
