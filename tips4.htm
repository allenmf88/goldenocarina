Masks</b></font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">After a ways into the game
when you are still a kid (you can go back after you become an adult but it is
easier to do it right at the beginning of the game) you visit the Hyrule Castle
Town. In the Hyrule Castle town there is a &quot;Happy Mask Shop&quot; which
will be of great attention to you, the reader.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#808000">NOTE: </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">After
you get paid for each mask go back to the &quot;Happy Mask Shop&quot; and talk
to the guy he will ask for his money and then a new mask will be available and
choose that one.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">1.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
When you first go there, there is one mask available, The Keaton Mask. Ask to
borrow this mask and take it to the guard in Kakariko Village guarding the gate
to Death Mountain. Put on the mask and talk to the guy he then pays you money
for the mask.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">2. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">The
next mask is the Skull Mask. In order to sell this mask you must know Saria's
Song. Play the song for him and he gives you a piece of a heart. Then 'Z-Target'
him with your mask on. Talk to him. He will pay you for the mask.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">3. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">The
next mask is the Spooky Mask. Go to the graveyard during the day in Kakariko
Village. Remember that kid well he will buy the mask from you.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">4.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
The next mask is the Bunny Hood. This is the hardest to sell. You have to wander
around Lon Lon Ranch to find a guy running. Once you find him follow him, it
takes a long time. But sooner or later he will stop and put on the mask, talk to
him and he will buy it, and I think max. out your money!</font></b>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">5.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
Then return to the Happy Mask Shop and four masks become available The Zora
Mask, The Goron Mask, The Gerudo Mask, and The Mask of Truth. The Mask of Truth
is the only one with real value to you the other I think are just for fun.
Remember those statues that tell you the time when you hit them well if you wear
the mask and talk to one it will give you some kind of hint.</font></b>
