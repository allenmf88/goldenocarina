  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size="2"><font color="#ffff00"><b>I've
  finally been told the whereabouts of the triforce, so don't waste your time on
  those rumors I've read about on your site. All of that &quot;secret&quot; or
  &quot;lost&quot; dungeon stuff</b></font><b> </b><font color="#ffff00"><b>is
  crap. I've got the truth written write here. If your not believing me maybe
  you should know that my second cousin is one of the vice presidents of NOA. I
  called her up and finally got in touch with her. I asked her, &quot;where the
  heck is the triforce?&quot; She told me that wasn't her department but she
  said she would try to get some information to me. Well, after about a week of
  waiting I finally got an email from her. It said that she had to go through
  alot of stuff to get the info but it finally came. She also said that the
  whole reason nobody knows where it is is because NOA decided to keep it a
  secret for about a year ( or until Zelda64 sales go down) to announce this
  secret hoping it would get people playing Zelda again. She also told me to
  keep this info a secret and not go spread it across the internet Heh heh heh.
  Well here it is First</b></font><b> </b><font color="#ffff00"><b>of all you
  have to have already beaten the game and viewed the ended. OK this next part
  is a little tricky but of course a secret like this isn't going to be easy! It
  dosnt matter if you've died already but you do have to have all 100
  skulltullas (a reward a little more satisfying than that gold rupee huh). You
  don't have to have all the heart pieces either. First blow all the gossip
  stones into space using the bombs. You must keep track with which ones you've
  already shot off because they reappear (note: leave the 4 stones infront of
  the temple of time because you can't bomb them). Once this long feat is
  completed go to Link's house. Now play the song of time anywhere in his house
  ( you won't hear any noise but trust me it's working). Now go to Lon Lon Ranch
  and stand in front of Malon. Again play the song of time. Now play the same
  song once more any where inside the windmill in Kakorika village. Now this
  next part really surprised me. OK now return to links house and guess who will
  be waiting for you ...dark link, he will be sitting on the center table, he
  won't talk to you until you play sarias song. then after a short conversation
  he will teach you a very important song &quot;the song of the sages&quot;(you
  must remember it because it won't appear on the quest status menu) which will
  warp you to the sacred realm (this song</b></font><b> </b><font color="#ffff00"><b>will
  not work any where except in front of the 3 spiritual stones.( there will be a
  platform there, so it is sort of obvious where to play the song). At your
  arrival at the sacred realm you will find that all of the sages have been
  trapped in a large cage by Ganon. They tell you that the only way to set them
  free, save hyrule, and obtain the entire triforce is to defeat Ganon again.
  They combined their power to form another rainbow bridge leading down to a
  door. inside you will see the triforce.( it is not the same as your
  screenshot) if you walk towards the triforce, a green sphere will appear
  around it. ganon will fall from the ceiling and the fight will start. he will
  suck all of your weapons and shields and you will have to use the kid sword.
  It took me 52or 53 tries to finally defeat him.as soon as he is dead, the
  sphere around the triforce disappears. Hyrules returns to normal, the sages
  are rescued, and Zelda becomes ruler of Hyrule, and most important the
  triforce is yours (and it does show up on your quest status sheet). I know
  your probably not believing this but trust me. You won't regret it because the
  satisfaction of finally obtaining the triforce is great .</b></font></font>

I am not going to tell you how to obtain the Triforce, but I will tell you to
think back to the story that the Deku tree had told you after you beat Gohma.
Now either start a new game to freshen your memory on it or just try to remember
it. Now, all those rumors people saying you have to do this and that, and blow
that thing up, they are all wrong. The Triforce is anywhere that you choose to
access it at. You just have to do the right thing to access it. Well, that's all
I will say on the Triforce, lets see if you people can figure it out.</font></b>

can get a golden cow, that gives you invensibility. To do this, you have to get
30 seconds on the obstacle coarse. If you do this, you will be entered in a
horse steeple chase, racing against weirdos on cows. If you obtain a score of
1000 pts. you get a certificate to get a golden bottle. You give this to the
cucco lady, and she teaches you a song called Sonitina of the Cows. Play this
song for Ingo, and he will reward you, after a dumb speech, a golden cow.</font></b>

You have to start a new game and get up to the water temple. DO NOT BEAT THE
TEMPLE!!!! First go out of the pond and shoot a arrow into the MOON. Then play
the song of storms anywhere in the dried up lake. Now quickly look for a golden
door and go in it. There will be a lady. She gives you the armor. Before you
sing the song of storms, you must wear the Red Tunic, have bombs in down c,
arrows in left c, and the Ocarina of time in right c. My friend says he got it,
but I don't believe him at all.<br>

I was talking to a friend of mine who is one of the lucky Nintendo testers, and
I asked him about the Triforce in Zelda 64. He said you could get the Triforce.
I said no way. I went to his house and he showed me it; it was like your
screenshots of it. He didn't show me how, the bastard! He said to figure it out
by myself! I told him to go to HE-double-hockey-stick. He has one of those
offical nintendo private walkthroughs that no one else gets to look at except
the employees things. I am desparately searching for the Force, but to no avail.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Sequel</font><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
It has said to be rumored that there is going to be a sequel to &quot; The
Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time &quot; for N64. It is rumored that there was a
plot to make game players more anxious to see why Link did not get the Triforce
in Ocarina of Time. This sequal might contain Sheik ( Princess Zelda ) as the
main character with Link coming in later. That is all I know right now about it
but if I find more I will mail you back.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Triforce rumor-</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">
I have some info on the Triforce. My friend(jerk) decided to show not how to do
it, but where it is. actually, he didn't show me, he told me (while my arm was
around his throat). It is in --THE MARKET????? I can't find it! it is The market
of young Link, at twilight?? I don't know this for a fact, just what he told me.
??You have to go into the market at twilight, then the Temple of time, go to
adult link, the Kill the first zombie you see. This is as far as I have been
able to get. After I killed it, another jumped me. Then go to the ruins of the
bazzar shop, then play the Zelda song. A hole will open, and a chest inside has
the Force?????</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">P.S. He also said that around 47%
of all Regular edition and about 0.5% Gold editions have a glitch that keeps
from getting the Triforce.</font>

</font><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Triforce rumor- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">After
you beat Ganon with 0 deaths, you do a couple things, then the portal to the
Sacred Realm opens in Temple of Time. You and ZElda use your Triforce pieces,
and entyer. You must search the Sacred Realm for the Lost Dungeon, the former
resting place of the Triforce. when Ganon touched the Triforce, he corrupted the
Sacred Realm. he stiill had the Triforce of Power when you put him in the Void.
You and Zelda need to go to the Sacred Temple (now the Lost Dungeon), to where
the triforce laid. you and Zelda must use your Triforces to bring the Triforce
of Power back from Ganon's hands, and put them back 2 getha in the Sacred Realm.
Zelda can give you hints, she follows you. I'm in front of the BOSS door, in a
room full of Moblins. I need to kill them all under a minute to open the bars
leading to the boss door. I ask Zelda for help, and she just says &quot;I think
these moblins are the key tp getting thru that large door.&quot; the moblins
keep cumin back 2 life, and i can't get to the boss. I've heard about the boss,
it's a Shadow of your worst nightmares. So, you must fight &quot;shadows&quot;
of some old bosses, with new moves. They include dark link, Twinrova, Volvagia,
Bongo Bongo, and of course a ganondorf shadow. I've just read about the boss in
a magazine. PLEASE HELP!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Rumors- </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">There
are two rumors that I know of. One is that the Nintendo screwed over the
Americans by giving us a bug version, that does not have the full and true
ending like the Jap kinds have if any one has the jap version plz help me out on
this. Too that some say that the bug in the game was a accident and Nintendo had
all ready sent out the American version to stores, but was able to fix the bug
on the jap version and get it stocked up before the release date, also they say
that they are coming out with a 1.00 version if I may say that (Like they did
with Goldenly) And it will be out soon. Not sure on that do not hold me to it.
The other rumor is that there is a trick ending like say if you do every thing
in the game (Some of it might not even be mentioned in any walkthrough) then
beat Ganon is the scared realm. Then you need to go to the three dungeons of
Din, ect (I can not remember there names on the spot) kill all the monsters, and
bosses that he has but there to guard the three and each one of them gives you a
piece of the triforce the it all comes together and screen goes white and you
are in your room, you are little and Saria has just woke you up and says
&quot;that must have been some dream because you were talking so load that you
woke up every one in the forest. Come on lets go play in Lost Woods, and on the
way you can tell me about your dream on the way there.&quot; Then you go with
her fairy less and the screen pulls back to a sky look of all of Hyrule and Din
ect. fly across the screen and spell out in there colors friends for ever. Then
screen goes black and the credits roll. That story sounds to be real or someone
made it up that has a lot of time on there hands. If anyone has the Jap version
plz try to clear this up. I use Jap not to be mean just as short. To all that
read this tell me if you know any thing, or any other thing to do in the game.</font>

child, take the fisherman's hat by casting at point blank range (don't try this
at home!) and then use the hat as a net to catch the Hyrule Loach (that black
snake thing). Now take it to the blad pong owner. He'll say &quot;I have to
leave for a second&quot;. Now's you chance! Get out the bombs and blow up that
crack with the stream flowing out and there it is! This pond has a much bigger
fish! Be sure to save before you try this, because if you lose the guy's hat you
can't get it back.&nbsp;</font>

in the pipe and the bomb will fall in the middle of the lava under Ganons tower.
The lake of lava will dry out and you can jump down and get to &quot;tempel of

she gives you the song &quot;Harmony of Life&quot;. This song can teleport you
any where in Hyrule. To get to the Temple of the Sky you must have at least 4
sage medallions, then you go to the Temple ofTime (you must know the Prelude of
Light). Then you must go to any 4 temples and then teleport back to the Temple
of Time(you can't teleport to the4 temples).Then you put your sword back in the
pedestal of time. Then you go to the market &amp; find a girl who is chasing the
cucco, talk to herand then go back to the Temple of Time &amp; take out your
sword, go to Ganondorf's Castle. All the lava will be gone. Leave the castle and
out side there are all those Monsters that you freeze with the Sun's song. Kill
them all without using the Sun's song And when there all dead goto the center of
the ex-market and then play the Suns song.&nbsp;</font></p>
